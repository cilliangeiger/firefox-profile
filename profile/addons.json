This webextension tries to extract the final url from the intermediary url and goes there straight away if successful. As an example, try this url:\n\n- www.google.com/chrome/?or-maybe-rather-firefox=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mozilla.org/\n\nPlease give feedback(see below) if you find websites where this fails or where you get redirected in a weird way when this add-on is enabled but not when it's disabled.\n\nSee the add-on's preferences (also available by clicking the toolbar icon) for options.\n\nBy default all URLs but the ones matching a no-skip-urls-list are checked for embedded URLs and redirects are skipped. Depending on the pages visited, this can cause problems. For example a dysfunctional login. The no-skip-urls-list can be edited to avoid these problems. There is also a skip-urls-list mode to avoid this kind of problem altogether. In skip-urls-list mode, all URLs for which redirects should be skipped need to be added to the skip-urls-list manually.\n\nSome websites use multiple url parameters like this:\n\n`www.example.com/page-we-want-to-skip?first=www.want-to-go-here.com&second=www.do-not-care-about-this-url.com`\n\nSkip Redirect does not know which is the right parameter, but you can edit the no-skip-parameter-list. Adding `first` would skip to the URL of `second` and vice versa. Adding both, `first` and `second` would cause no skipping.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n--------------\n\nThis extension does not collect or send data of any kind to third parties.\n\nFeedback\n--------\n\nYou
